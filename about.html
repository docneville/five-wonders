      <h1>What is Five Wonders?</h1>
      <p>
        Five Wonders is an invite-only app for sharing the places you <em>actually</em> love —
        the coffee shops, bakeries, parks, bookstores, and weird little spots
        you’d recommend to a close friend, not an algorithm.
      </p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Add</strong> – Use the <a href="add-place.html">Add</a> page to search a place
          on the map or just drop a pin, tweak the name, and add your own note about why it’s great.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>View</strong> – Open the <a href="view.html">View</a> map to see your friends’
          saved places, with markers you can click for notes and more info.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Edit</strong> – Use the <a href="edit-places.html">Edit</a> page to update or
          remove places you’ve added.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who can use it?</h2>
      <p>
        Right now Five Wonders is an invite-only beta. Each person gets a private invite code
        that ties their saved places to their profile. That lets the <a href="view.html">View</a>
        map show who saved what, and eventually makes it possible to filter by friends.
      </p>

      <h2>Why does it exist?</h2>
      <p>
        Most review platforms optimize for volume and engagement (TripAdvisor, Yelp, Google).
        Five Wonders is the opposite: trusted recommendations layered on top of a map, powered
        by people you actually know.
