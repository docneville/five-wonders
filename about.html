    <h1>What is Five Wonders?</h1>
    <p>
      Five Wonders is an invite-only app for sharing the places you <em>actually</em> love —
      the coffee shops, bakeries, parks, bookstores, and weird little spots
      you’d recommend to a close friend, not an algorithm.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Add</strong> – Use the <a href="add-place.html">Add</a> page to search for a place
        or drop a pin, tweak the name, and write why it matters to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>View</strong> – Open the <a href="view.html">View</a> map to explore friends’
        recommendations, with notes and context.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Edit</strong> – Use the <a href="edit-places.html">Edit</a> page to update or remove
        places you’ve added.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who can use it?</h2>
    <p>
      Five Wonders is currently an invite-only beta. Each person has a private invite code
      that links their saved places to their profile. This lets the map show who saved what,
      and eventually enables filtering by friends.
    </p>

    <h2>Why does it exist?</h2>
    <p>
      Most review platforms optimize for volume and engagement. Five Wonders is the opposite:
      a small, trusted layer of recommendations on top of a map — powered by people you
      actually know.
